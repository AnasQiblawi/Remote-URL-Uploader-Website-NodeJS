Help me develop this app

To do List:
- Better file naming code.
- naming code from request headers, 
  using res.headers['content-disposition'] if filename found in it.
- Getting file extension type from request headers using res.headers['Content-Type'] if found,
  be aware, sometimes it gives strange types like 'application/octet-stream' for an .mp4 file
- add custome name option.
- Live Progress bar while uploading and disable uploading button while it's on progress.
- Prevent downloading files that are still on uploading progress.
- Better CSS for Files list on desktops and mobiles,
  Or maybe I should put everything on one page for submiting URLs and seeing all files.
